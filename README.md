# SHT4x for Arduino
A simple Arduino library for the Sensirion SHT4x humidity and temperature sensors (SHT40, SHT41, SHT45).

# Installation
Create a SHT4x folder in your Arduino/libraries folder and copy the content of this repository in it.

# How to use it
There's an example in the *examples* folder that can be opened straight from the Arduino interface.
For further details, you may refer to the comments and descriptions in SHT4x.h or ask me.
I've tested it on Arduino (Mega, Nano) and ESP32. I'm interested to know of any return on experience for other platforms compatible with the Arduino toolchain.
